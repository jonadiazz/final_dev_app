# final_dev_app

<h6>A simple application that makes use of a database (sqlite3), subversion control (git), apache2 for deployment in conjunction with Django as a framework. The application is aimed to store most visited sites titles and their logo urls. We plan to do this by using regexes with Python.

<h5>The app is hosted on Amazon Web Services and accessible. Still, not functional.
